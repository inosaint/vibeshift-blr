keyboard
- keyboard layout to have 4 rows
- fixed to page bottom
- responsive to the device width
- 4th row has delete, breathe and enter
- breathe looks wide like a spacebar but its not connected to the real spacebar due to its conflicting behaviour within the game

info-bar
- two columned div
	- left div
		- the hint bubble should be flat styled like the keyboard letters
		- the speech bubble is pointed towards the chat head
	- right div
		- has the stats stacked as current

music grid sequencer
- taking inspiration from abelton
- there are 5 letters in every word
- now each letter is represented by a grid of 6 rows and 3 columns, a pixel grid
- there is spacing between each letter for legiibility
- the letters typed show up as a shade of black which aligns with the css styling
- each letter willl feel like a different instrument 
- each square in the button on the letter grid would have a logic related to the tone that would play
- last letter should be representative of a drum so a beat is being set as sequence is being run
- sequencer is dreamy sound themed
